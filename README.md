# ggplot for python

## CFP
Making basic, good-looking plots in Python is tough. Matplotlib gives you great
control, but at the expense of being very detailed. The rise of pandas has made
Python the go-to language for data wrangling and munging but many people are 
still reluctant to leave R because of its outstanding data viz packages. ggplot
is a port of the popular R package ggplot2. It provides a high level grammar
that allow users to quickly and easily make good looking plots. So say good-bye 
to matplotlib, and hello to ggplot as your everyday Python plotting library!
